# U.S. Equity Investment Outlook – Q3 & Q4 2025 (with 2026 Preview)

## 1. Macroeconomic Overview

Recent data suggest a soft-landing scenario:
- **CPI**: June CPI rose 2.7% YoY (up from 2.4% in May); core CPI at 2.9%.
- **Labor Market**: Jobless claims hit 3-month lows in July, while July payrolls slowed to +73K. The job market remains firm.
- **Federal Reserve Outlook**: The CME FedWatch Tool shows a ~45–50% chance of a rate cut in September 2025, with two total cuts expected by year-end.

**Implication**: Lower borrowing costs support equities, particularly rate-sensitive sectors such as REITs and utilities.

## 2. Sector Outlook

### Healthcare – **Underweight**
- The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA) cuts $1.1T in federal healthcare spending through FY2034.
- Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement pressures hurt health insurers and hospitals.
- Defensive large-cap pharma firms with global exposure (e.g., JNJ, PFE) may be safer bets.
- Valuations are reasonable but uncertainty remains elevated.

### Technology & AI – **Overweight**
- OBBBA provides tax incentives and grants for AI infrastructure, semiconductors, and cloud.
- Strong earnings from AI-driven growth in MSFT, META, AMZN, GOOGL.
- GENIUS Act boosts stablecoin regulation, fostering blockchain adoption.
- Valuations remain high, but large-cap leaders with earnings visibility remain compelling.

### Energy (Oil/Nuclear) – **Overweight**
- OBBBA removes green subsidies; favors fossil fuels and nuclear.
- OPEC+ production increases expected to keep oil prices moderate.
- Beneficiaries: XOM, CVX (stable dividends), SO, NEE (nuclear utility players).
- Avoid pure-play renewables.

### Industrials/Financials – **Neutral to Overweight**
- Deregulation benefits traditional industries and banks.
- Small-cap manufacturers, banks gain margin relief.
- Large-cap players like JPM remain safe, profitable and policy-advantaged.
- Consider valuation-sensitive industrial and bank stocks with solid balance sheets.

### REITs – **Overweight (Conservative)**
- Sensitive to rate cuts; lower financing costs boost valuation.
- Industrial and storage REITs likely to outperform.
- Top conservative picks: Realty Income (O), Public Storage (PSA) with 4–5% yields.

## 4. Investment Strategy

- **Conservative Tilt**: Focus on companies with strong free cash flow, low debt, and stable dividends.
- **Avoid**: Small caps unless deep value is present; clean-energy developers vulnerable to policy risk.
- **Monitor**: Fed policy shifts, sector rotations, geopolitical tariff risks.
- **Outlook 2026**: Inflation trajectory and Fed posture are key; defensives likely to remain in favor if growth moderates.
